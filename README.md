In this project, a training dataset of 20000 users' following status were given. To be more specific, the users thats been followed by the 20000 users were given. The target of this is to utilise the data given in a machine learning context to train a model and to predict whether a given follower-followee relationship exists or not. A test dataset of 2000 real and fake relationships were used to test the result of the models. A flowchart of the general idea of how we approach the problem is provided below,
